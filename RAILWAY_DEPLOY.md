# üöÇ Railway Deployment Guide

Complete step-by-step guide to deploy your Document Q&A application on Railway (backend) and Vercel/Netlify (frontend).

## üìã Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
- ‚úÖ GitHub account
- ‚úÖ Railway account (sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app))
- ‚úÖ Vercel or Netlify account (for frontend)

## üîß Part 1: Backend Deployment on Railway

### Step 1: Create New Railway Project

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and log in
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Choose your repository: `document-QA-assistent`
5. Railway will detect it's a Node.js project automatically

### Step 2: Configure Railway Service

1. After creating the project, click on your service
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Configure the following:

#### Root Directory (Important!)
- Set **Root Directory** to: `backend`
- This tells Railway to deploy only the backend folder

#### Start Command
Railway should auto-detect, but verify:
```bash
node index.js
```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

In Railway, go to the **Variables** tab and add:

| Variable Name | Value | Description |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `your_actual_api_key` | Your Google Gemini API key |
| `PORT` | `3002` (optional) | Railway auto-assigns a port, but you can specify |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | `https://your-frontend.vercel.app` | Your deployed frontend URL (add after frontend deployment) |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: After you deploy your frontend, come back here and update `FRONTEND_URL`!

### Step 4: Deploy Backend

1. Click **"Deploy"** or push changes to your GitHub repo
2. Railway will automatically build and deploy
3. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
4. Your backend will be available at: `https://your-app.railway.app`

### Step 5: Get Your Backend URL

1. Go to **Settings** tab in Railway
2. Under **Domains**, you'll see your app URL
3. **Copy this URL** - you'll need it for frontend deployment!
4. Example: `https://document-qa-backend-production.up.railway.app`

### Step 6: Test Backend Health

Open your browser and visit:
```
https://your-app.railway.app/api/health
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Backend is running",
  "port": 3002,
  "geminiAI": true,
  "embeddings": false
}
```

‚úÖ If you see this, your backend is working!

## üé® Part 2: Frontend Deployment on Vercel

### Step 1: Prepare Frontend Environment

Before deploying, update your production environment file:

1. Open `frontend/.env.production`
2. Replace the placeholder with your Railway backend URL:
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
```

3. Commit and push this change:
```bash
git add frontend/.env.production
git commit -m "Update production API URL"
git push
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and log in
2. Click **"Add New Project"**
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Configure project:
   - **Framework Preset**: Vite
   - **Root Directory**: `frontend`
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables in Vercel

In Vercel project settings, add:

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `VITE_API_URL` | `https://your-app.railway.app` |

### Step 4: Deploy Frontend

1. Click **"Deploy"**
2. Wait for build to complete (2-3 minutes)
3. Your frontend will be available at: `https://your-project.vercel.app`

### Step 5: Update Railway CORS

Now that you have your frontend URL, go back to Railway:

1. Open your Railway project
2. Go to **Variables** tab
3. Update or add `FRONTEND_URL`:
   ```
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-project.vercel.app
   ```
4. Railway will automatically redeploy with the new variable

## üîÑ Alternative: Deploy Frontend to Netlify

If you prefer Netlify over Vercel:

### Step 1: Prepare for Netlify

1. Update `frontend/.env.production` with your Railway URL
2. Create `frontend/netlify.toml`:
```toml
[build]
  base = "frontend"
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and log in
2. Click **"Add new site"** ‚Üí **"Import an existing project"**
3. Choose your GitHub repository
4. Configure:
   - **Base directory**: `frontend`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `frontend/dist`

### Step 3: Environment Variables

In Netlify, go to **Site settings** ‚Üí **Environment variables**:

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `VITE_API_URL` | `https://your-app.railway.app` |

### Step 4: Deploy and Update Railway

1. Deploy on Netlify
2. Copy your Netlify URL: `https://your-site.netlify.app`
3. Update `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway with your Netlify URL

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After deploying both frontend and backend:

### Backend Checks
- [ ] Visit `https://your-backend.railway.app/api/health`
- [ ] Should return status "ok"
- [ ] Check Railway logs for any errors
- [ ] Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly

### Frontend Checks
- [ ] Visit your frontend URL
- [ ] Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Console
- [ ] Check for CORS errors (should be none)
- [ ] Try uploading a PDF document
- [ ] Ask a question and verify AI response

### Integration Checks
- [ ] Upload a PDF successfully
- [ ] See document in viewer
- [ ] Ask questions and get AI responses
- [ ] Click on references to see highlighting
- [ ] Check browser Network tab - API calls should go to Railway backend

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: CORS Error

**Symptom**: Browser console shows CORS error when uploading or asking questions

**Solution**:
1. Check Railway environment variables
2. Ensure `FRONTEND_URL` matches your exact frontend URL (no trailing slash)
3. Redeploy backend after changing variables

### Issue 2: 404 on API Calls

**Symptom**: Frontend says "Failed to upload" or "Failed to get answer"

**Solution**:
1. Verify `VITE_API_URL` in frontend environment variables
2. Check it matches your Railway backend URL exactly
3. Rebuild and redeploy frontend

### Issue 3: Backend Fails to Start

**Symptom**: Railway shows "deployment failed" or constant restarts

**Solution**:
1. Check Railway logs (click on deployment)
2. Common issues:
   - Missing `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - Wrong root directory (should be `backend`)
   - Missing dependencies (run `npm install` in backend)

### Issue 4: PDF Processing Fails

**Symptom**: Upload succeeds but document won't display

**Solution**:
1. Check Railway logs for PDF parsing errors
2. Ensure `pdfjs-dist` is in `backend/package.json` dependencies
3. Verify file size is under 10MB

### Issue 5: AI Not Working

**Symptom**: Questions return empty or error messages

**Solution**:
1. Verify Gemini API key is valid
2. Check Railway logs for API errors
3. Ensure you're using `gemini-2.5-flash` model
4. Get new API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
